# Wiki
This is the wiki for the UMKC Galaxy Evolution Group. It contains information about how to do many of the things we do in everyday astronomy, as well as other handy resources. The main portion of this is found in the [wiki](https://github.com/UMKCgeg/Wiki/wiki), which can also be found in the top bar for this repository. The codes are hosted in the main page of the wiki.
